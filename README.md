Hi, I‚Äôm a Data Scientist with a background in Biomechanical Engineering, now focused on building innovative solutions at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and generative AI.

I began my career in mechanical engineering, where I learned to approach problems with rigor, creativity, and a strong foundation in design and mechancial systems. Over time, I transitioned into data science & AI/ML, teaching myself Python, SQL, Git, and modern ML/GenAI frameworks. Today, I apply those skills to create projects that are not only technically strong but also exciting, practical, and impactful.

‚ú® This portfolio is a work in progress‚Äînew projects and experiments will be added regularly as I continue to explore the exciting world of AI & Data Science.

üìÇ Projects
1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Churn Prediction

Type: Traditional Data Science / Machine Learning

Highlights: End-to-end ML workflow with EDA, feature engineering, model comparison, and explainability (SHAP).

Impact: Provides actionable strategies for reducing churn in subscription-based businesses.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Knowledge Base RAG Bot

Type: GenAI / Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Highlights: Built a chatbot that retrieves and answers questions from company documentation using embeddings + vector database.

Impact: Demonstrates how LLMs can be grounded to deliver trustworthy, enterprise-ready answers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Science Agent Assistant
